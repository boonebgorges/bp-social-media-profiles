Allows the admin of a BuddyPress installation to select profile fields that correspond to social media profiles (Twitter handles, Facebook URLs, etc), and display them separately as icons.

== Description ==

On some BuddyPress sites, you may provide profile fields where users can give their Twitter handles, Facebook URLs, Flickr IDs, and so forth. But this is of somewhat limited value, because (1) this data generally does not automatically link to these third-party services, and (2) the data appears in a long list of profile fields, which makes it visually unstimulating. 

BP Social Media Profiles allows the admin of a BuddyPress installation to associate profile fields with a list of provided social media sites, allowing for attractive and flexible display of that profile date. Features:

* Profile fields are linked automatically to the associated service (eg, a Twitter field will link to the user's Twitter profile)
* Profile fields can be displayed as icons
* Profile fields can be displayed in a "Follow Me" section in the header, instead of (or in addition to) the profile section
* Social Media fields accept different kinds of values. For example, the Twitter field will accept a Twitter URL (http://twitter.com/boone) or a Twitter username (boone or @boone)

The plugin is fully extensible, so that you can swap out your own icons, or add your own social networks.
